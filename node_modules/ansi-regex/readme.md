## Install

```
$ npm install ansi-rege***REMOVED***
```


## Usage

```js
const ansiRege***REMOVED*** = require('ansi-rege***REMOVED***');

ansiRege***REMOVED***().test('\u001B[4mcake\u001B[0m');
//=> true

ansiRege***REMOVED***().test('cake');
//=> false

'\u001B[4mcake\u001B[0m'.match(ansiRege***REMOVED***());
//=> ['\u001B[4m', '\u001B[0m']

'\u001B[4mcake\u001B[0m'.match(ansiRege***REMOVED***({onlyFirst: true}));
//=> ['\u001B[4m']

'\u001B]8;;https://github.com\u0007click\u001B]8;;\u0007'.match(ansiRege***REMOVED***());
//=> ['\u001B]8;;https://github.com\u0007', '\u001B]8;;\u0007']
```

## FAQ

### Why do you test for codes not in the ECMA 48 standard?

Some of the codes we run as a test are codes that we acquired finding various lists of non-standard or manufacturer specific codes. We test for both standard and non-standard codes, as most of them follow the same or similar format and can be safely matched in strings without the risk of removing actual string content. There are a few non-standard control codes that do not follow the traditional format (i.e. they end in numbers) thus forcing us to e***REMOVED***clude them from the test because we cannot reliably match them.

On the historical side, those ECMA standards were established in the early 90's whereas the VT100, for e***REMOVED***ample, was designed in the mid/late 70's. At that point in time, control codes were still pretty ungoverned and engineers used them for a multitude of things, namely to activate hardware ports that may have been proprietary. Somewhere else you see a similar 'anarchy' of codes is in the ***REMOVED***86 architecture for processors; there are a ton of "interrupts" that can mean different things on certain brands of processors, most of which have been phased out.
