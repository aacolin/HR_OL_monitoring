To install Node.js v20 on Fedora Linux 40, you can follow these steps:

1. First, add the NodeSource repository for Node.js 20.x:


```bash
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
```

2. Install Node.js using dnf:

```bash
sudo dnf install nodejs

This command will install Node.js v20.x along with npm (Node Package Manager).

3. After the installation is complete, you can verify the installed version by running:

```bash
node -v

This should display the installed version of Node.js, which should be v20.x.
