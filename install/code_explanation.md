### package.json

The active selection is a script entry from a [`package.json`](package.json ) file, which is used in Node.js projects to define various scripts that can be run using npm.

```json
"start": "nodemon --ext js,json,html,css ./bin/www"
```

This line defines a script named `start` that can be executed with the command `npm start`. The script uses `nodemon`, a utility that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected.

The `nodemon` command is configured with the following options:
- `--ext js,json,html,css`: This option specifies the file extensions that `nodemon` should watch for changes. In this case, it watches for changes in files with `.js`, `.json`, `.html`, and `.css` extensions.
- `bin/www`: This is the entry point of the application. It specifies the file that should be executed to start the server. The `bin/www`

 file is typically used in Express.js applications to set up and start the HTTP server.
